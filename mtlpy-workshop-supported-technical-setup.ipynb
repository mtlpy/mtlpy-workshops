      "Preparation of a technical environment that will be supported in Montr\u00e9al-Python's workshops.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "These short instructions will able you to setup a fully functional and performant Python developer workstation on Ubuntu or Debian.\n",
      "\n",
      "We strongly recommand to have this workstation setup for all Montr\u00e9al-Python's workshop because :\n",
      "\n",
      "* the technical support in the workshops will be guaranteed for Ubuntu or Debian based Linux station\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to have fun with the code in Montr\u00e9al-Python workshops without loosing your time with configuring your machine, offer yourself a development environment where Python is a first class citizen. Otherwise, come a bit earlier at the workshop, we'll help you set it up. It's simple. It's powerful.\n",

      "## VirtualBox\n",
      "\n",
      "You're on Mac OS X or Windows? You don't already have a Linux distribution as a developer workstation? You can install one on your computer without interferring with your normal operating system. To do this, you'll install a virtual machine managed by Oracle VM VirtualBox software.\n",

      "1. Download the appropriate version of Virtualbox according to your operating system [approx. 100 Mb] : <br />\n",

      "## Ubuntu\n",
      "\n",
      "Ubuntu is a Linux operating system based on Debian. Python is a first class citizen there. We prepared you a ready-to-install Ubuntu shipped with everything needed to make Python development. Let's download now these Ubuntu sources and install Ubuntu in the Virtualbox.\n",

      "2- Download the appropriate Ubuntu image at the following url: [http://montrealpython.org/en/data/Montreal-Python-32bit-Ubuntu-12_04.ova](http://montrealpython.org/en/data/Montreal-Python-32bit-Ubuntu-12_04.ova) [1,7 Go]\n",
