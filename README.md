# mtlpy-workshops

Montr√©al-Python workshops (presentations, exercises... all the needed material).

of the appropriate language code.

## Publishing

The .ipynb files are published via http://nbviewer.ipython.org.
We give the raw version of the file to the nbviewer service.
It returns the .ipynb file rendered behind a long URL...
... so we shorten them via a service of URL shortener like bit.ly
then we communicate this shortened URL.

Be careful of the branch your on when you choose the raw .ipynb file to publish :
every commit updating this file in this branch will automatically update the 
published version in the nbviewer. (Use master for the latest official version.)

Also, moving around the .ipynb files in the repo will break the links in your 
previous publications.

### Full example

File : 
/mtlpy-workshop-supported-technical-setup-fr.ipynb

Github URL :
https://github.com/mtlpy/mtlpy-workshops/blob/master/mtlpy-workshop-supported-technical-setup-fr.ipynb

RAW Github URL :
https://raw.github.com/mtlpy/mtlpy-workshops/master/mtlpy-workshop-supported-technical-setup-fr.ipynb

Nbviewer URL :
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/mtlpy/mtlpy-workshops/master/mtlpy-workshop-supported-technical-setup-fr.ipynb

So, we end with the diffusion of something like this :
